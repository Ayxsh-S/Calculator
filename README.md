# Calculator

Created a calculator. Supports keyboard and decimal points.
There is a bug when using the keyboard as not all functions are called unless the buttons are pressed ie the display doesnt clear when the user starts a new calculation.
Also javascript may give unnatural results to simple calculations such as 0.7-0.1
Doesnt follow rules of BIDMAS
